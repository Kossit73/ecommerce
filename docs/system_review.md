# Ecommerce Model Code Review

## Overview
The repository now ships two primary client surfaces — the offline `streamlit_app.py` dashboard and the static HTML console in `frontend/`. Both are expected to run entirely from the assumption schedules defined by the user. The FastAPI backend (`main.py`, `ecommerce.py`) still contains the original service endpoints and analytics workflows. This review validates the wiring between these components and highlights actionable improvements for optimization, automation, and maintainability.

## Verification Highlights
- **Workbook resolution.** The `EcommerceModel` previously hard-coded `data/financial_assumptions.xlsx`. The repo only includes `financial_assumptions.xlsx` in the root, so fresh loads failed. The model now resolves the workbook by probing both locations before falling back to `data/` so deployments succeed regardless of where the file lives.
- **Streamlit pipeline.** The offline pipeline produces synchronized financial statements, scenario summaries, and analytics derived directly from the schedules entered on the Input tab. The helper functions at the top of `streamlit_app.py` clamp the production horizon, normalize each schedule, and recompute the model whenever state changes. The derived outputs feed every downstream tab (Key Metrics, Performance, Position, Cash Flow, Sensitivity, Advanced Analysis).
- **Statement diagnostics.** `streamlit_app.py` now runs automated consistency checks across the income statement, balance sheet, and cash-flow schedule after each recomputation. Any tie-outs that drift beyond a 0.01 tolerance are surfaced to the user via the Key Financial Metrics tab.
- **Static console.** The static frontend (`frontend/assets/js/*.js`) continues to provide a zero-dependency alternative that mirrors the same workflows when a browser is preferred over Streamlit.

## Observed Strengths
- The assumption schedules are normalized through `sanitize_tables` and `apply_derived_assumption_values`, ensuring staffing, benefits, asset depreciation, and debt amortization are recalculated before any analytics run.
- `compute_model_outputs` orchestrates the full pipeline — revenue, profitability, balance sheet, cash flow, customer metrics, valuation metrics, and visualization payloads are all derived from the sanitized tables. This minimizes duplicated logic across the various tabs.
- Advanced tooling such as Monte Carlo simulation, what-if overlays, decision analysis, and budget optimization are encapsulated in dedicated helpers, making the Advanced Analysis tab extensible.

## Improvement Opportunities
1. **Performance tuning for repeated recomputations.** Every edit to the assumption tables recomputes the full model synchronously. Consider caching intermediate results (e.g., scenario dataframes, valuation metrics) keyed by a hash of the relevant schedules to reduce recalculation overhead during intensive editing sessions.
2. **Modularization of Streamlit utilities.** `streamlit_app.py` has grown beyond 3,000 lines. Extracting logical modules (assumption editing, core financial engine, visualization builders) into separate files would simplify testing and make it easier to reuse the calculation engine outside Streamlit.
3. **Backend dependency audit.** The FastAPI backend still declares heavy optional dependencies (`networkx`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `statsmodels`) even though the Streamlit app now operates offline. Splitting runtime vs. optional extras into tiered requirement files would streamline deployments that only need the offline console.
4. **Automated testing.** Beyond `compileall`, no automated checks exist. Adding unit tests for core financial helpers (e.g., `build_asset_schedule`, `build_debt_amortization_schedule`, `_apply_incremental_fill`) would provide regression coverage as the assumption editor evolves.
5. **Consistent API data contract.** If the FastAPI backend remains an optional integration point, align its serialization schema with the offline model output so both surfaces stay interchangeable. Shared dataclasses or Pydantic models would reduce duplication between `compute_model_outputs` and the backend’s scenario builders.
6. **Documentation for advanced tooling assumptions.** Several advanced analytics (Monte Carlo, neural forecasts, optimization) rely on simplified models inside `streamlit_app.py`. Documenting their statistical assumptions and expected input ranges in the README will help operators interpret the outputs correctly.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Introduce a lightweight regression suite that loads a deterministic set of assumptions and asserts the resulting cash flow, balance sheet, and valuation metrics.
- Refactor the Streamlit code into a `streamlit_app/` package to separate data preparation from UI rendering, facilitating future automation or batch usage.
- Evaluate whether the static console can consume the offline computation engine (perhaps by exporting the logic to a shared TypeScript/pyodide bundle) to guarantee parity across all user interfaces.
